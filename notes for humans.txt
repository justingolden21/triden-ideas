Hi, this is a text document from Justin.

I included this document to make your lives easier if you're trying to figure out how any of the files work.

This website was made with Jekyll. If you want to learn more about it, you can find their website here: https://jekyllrb.com

Firstly, I'll detail how to push your changes after you've updated the website, if you need to update anything for any reason:

Note: You should have Jekyll installed first. You only have to do this once.

	1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the location of this folder.

	2. Run the command "jekyll build --watch" (without quotes). The "--watch" part will keep the website "watching" for any change and building afterwards

	3. All done! Your most recent build will be stored in the "_site" folder. Simply copy the contents of that folder to wherever you want to use them.

Next, I'll detail the file structure:

	* The data folder is where I'm storing all data in the form of .json files. Right now it's only the social media information, so I can create those links dynamically, and so it's easier for you humans to update.
		* The part you see that starts with "fab" is the class for the corresponding font awesome icon to that social media service. To browse all icons, go to: https://fontawesome.com/icons

	* The includes folder is where I'm storing all of the HTML files that are included in multiple pages, so I don't have to copy/paste the information across all pages. Once of the great things about services like Jekyll.

	* The layouts folder includes the layouts/templates for what different pages can look like. Right now, I've only got one layout there.

	* The assets folder includes all assets in the form of style sheets (css), javascript (js), as well as images and video. I'm currently not including any fonts.

	* Lastly, the main directory has all of the HTML files for each page, the .gitignore and README are for Github, the _config.yml is for Jekyll, the Licence is just the MIT licence I copied from Github, and the TODO and notes files are for my reference.

Hopefully, this little document helps some human wondering how these files are organized, or how to push a minor change, or saves an unnecessary email.
